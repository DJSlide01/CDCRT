Query: How would I automate the entire process of creating an animated series, using only free to use and publicly available ai/ml models, services, and tools.

Creating an animated series is a complex and time-consuming task that involves multiple steps, including scriptwriting, storyboarding, character design, animation, and post-production. However, there are several free-to-use and publicly available AI/ML models, services, and tools that can help automate some of these processes. Here are some suggestions:

    Scriptwriting: While AI-generated scripts may not be perfect, they can provide inspiration and generate ideas. You can use GPT-3-powered tools like Sudowrite [10] or the AI story generator by Botnik Studios [6] to generate story ideas or even full-length scripts.

    Storyboarding: AI-powered tools like Boords [6] can help you create storyboards quickly and efficiently. Boords is a free tool that allows you to create storyboards, collaborate with others, and export your work as a PDF.

    Character design: AI-powered character design tools like RunwayML [6] and Ganbreeder [6] can help you generate unique and interesting characters for your series. RunwayML is a free, web-based tool that allows you to generate characters using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), while Ganbreeder is a free, web-based tool that allows you to evolve images using GANs.

    Animation: While there are several AI-powered animation tools available, most of them are not free. However, you can use Blender [6], a free and open-source 3D animation software, to create your animations. Blender has a steep learning curve, but there are several tutorials available online to help you get started.

    Post-production: You can use AI-powered tools like Wisecut [8] and Kroma.AI [7] to automate the post-production process. Wisecut is a free tool that allows you to remove long pauses, add background music, and include subtitles to create engaging videos. Kroma.AI is a more expensive tool but offers a free option and specializes in pitch deck designs that will make investors say yes.

It is worth noting that while AI/ML models, services, and tools can help automate some parts of the process, creating an animated series still requires significant time and effort. However, by leveraging these tools, you can streamline your workflow and focus on the creative aspects of the project.

Expand upon your previous response.

Certainly! Here are some additional details and steps to consider if you want to automate the entire process of creating an animated series using free and publicly available AI/ML models, services, and tools:

    Scriptwriting: Use AI-powered writing tools to generate the script for your animated series. There are several options available, including Talk to Transformer by Hugging Face, Copysmith, and AI Dungeon. These tools use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to generate text based on your inputs.

    Storyboarding: Once you have a script, you can use AI-powered storyboarding tools to create visual representations of each scene in your animated series. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit and Plot by AISomplex are some examples of free AI-powered storyboarding tools.

    Character design: Use free tools such as Adobe Character Animator or Reallusion's Character Creator to design the characters for your animated series. You can also use AI-generated art and graphics to create unique and original character designs. ArtBreeder is an AI-powered tool that allows you to create custom art by combining and evolving various images.

    Animation: You can use AI-powered animation tools to automate the animation process. Animaker and Adobe Animate are some examples of tools that offer AI-powered animation features. You can also use 3D animation effects in PowerPoint to add depth and dimension to your animated series [4].

    Voice acting: You can use text-to-speech (TTS) tools to generate voices for your animated characters. NaturalReader and TTSReader are some examples of free TTS tools that offer a range of voices and accents. You can also use AI-powered voice cloning tools to create custom voices for your characters. Replica Studios and Resemble AI are some examples of AI-powered voice cloning tools.

    Music and sound effects: Use AI-powered music and sound effect libraries to add music and sound effects to your animated series. Jukedeck and Amper Music are some examples of AI-powered music creation tools. For sound effects, you can use sites like ZapSplat and FreeSound, which offer free sound effects libraries.

    Video editing: Finally, you can use AI-powered video editing tools to edit and finalize your animated series. Some examples of free AI-powered video editing tools include Magisto, InVideo, and Wisecut [8].

Keep in mind that while these AI/ML models, services, and tools can help automate the process of creating an animated series, they may not be perfect substitutes for human creativity and input. It's important to experiment with these tools and find the right balance between automation and creative expression.

Show pipeline flow chart of the processes

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to create visual flowcharts, but I can provide you with a general overview of the process:

    Pre-production:
    a. Concept Development: Brainstorming and fleshing out the story idea and characters
    b. Script Writing: Writing the script for the episode
    c. Storyboarding: Creating visual representations of each shot in the episode
    Production:
    a. Character Design: Designing the characters for the show
    b. Background Design: Creating the background elements for each scene
    c. Animation: Bringing the characters and background to life through animation
    d. Sound Design: Adding sound effects, music, and dialogue to the animation
    Post-production:
    a. Editing: Cutting together the final version of the episode
    b. Color Correction

Show the best/cheapest pipeline/flow of the processes. Example: Copysmith>AISomplex>ArtBreeder>Animaker>Replica Studios>ZapSplat>Magisto

There are many possible pipelines to create an animated series using free or low-cost AI/ML tools and services, depending on the level of automation and the specific features required. Here's one possible example:

    Generate a script using GPT-3 language model from OpenAI Codex [10]
    Create storyboards with Storyboarder, a free tool that lets you sketch and organize your ideas [11]
    Use Adobe Character Animator or Adobe Animate to create animated characters. Adobe Character Animator can capture your facial expressions and movements to create expressive characters, while Adobe Animate provides traditional cartoon animation techniques [2]
    Animate the storyboards with Animaker, an AI-powered animation software for beginners and professionals [6]
    Enhance the animation with Kroma.ai, an AI tool that specializes in pitch deck designs and can add high-quality visuals to your videos [7]
    Add music and sound effects with ZapSplat, a free library of sound effects and music tracks [12]
    Use Magisto to edit the video and add transitions and special effects. Magisto is a free online video editor that uses AI to automate the editing process [8]
    Publish the finished video on social media and streaming platforms to reach your audience

This pipeline is cost-effective and relies mainly on free or low-cost tools, including GPT-3 from OpenAI, Storyboarder, Animaker, Kroma.ai, ZapSplat, and Magisto. However, keep in mind that some of these tools may have limitations or require additional paid features, and the quality of the final output may vary depending on the complexity of the project and the level of customization required.
